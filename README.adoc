WARNING: This gem is still under development.

_Formerly known as_ `asciidoctor-iso`.

== Functionality

This gem processes Metanorma documents following a template for generating ISO
International Standards. The following outputs are generated.

* The XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for ISO
International Standards. 

* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable ISO standard drafts.
** Microsoft Word output (`.doc`), following the style conventions of the 
https://www.iso.org/iso-templates.html[ISO Standard Microsoft Word template]. 
** HTML. For ISO, two HTML files are generated: the `.html` file follows ISO
conventions in rendering, which looks very similar to the Word output, while
the `-alt.html` file has richer styling.
** PDF. Not supported for the ISO gem, but available for other specifications,
generated from the HTML file.

The following input formats are supported:

* http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]
(This AsciiDoc syntax for writing ISO standards is hereby named "AsciiISO".)

This README provides an overview of the functionality of the gem; see also
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring[Guidance for authoring]
ISO standards using the gem. The 
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/wiki/Quickstart-Guide[Quickstart guide]
gives a summary overview.

NOTE: http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketting terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type iso a.adoc                   # output HTML and DOC
$ metanorma --type csd --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type csd --extensions doc a.adoc  # output just DOC
$ metanorma --type csd --extensions xml a.adoc  # output CSD XML
----

The gem translates the document into ISO XML format, and then
validates its output against the ISO XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML and DOC.

////
The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b iso -r 'metanorma-iso' a.adoc  
----

If you do not invoke the `iso` backend explicitly, the AsciiISO source will be
treated as generic Asciidoc markup, and will output an HTML preview that 
ignores the ISO-specific modifications to the markup:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor a.adoc  
----
////

=== Installation

If you are using a Mac, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-iso
----


=== Content Warnings

The gem also realises several format
checks as prescribed in ISO/IEC DIR 2:2018, and warns the user about them in the
console:

* Numbers with what looks like dots instead of commas for decimal points.

* Groups of numbers without spacing for every three digits. (The gem attempts
to ignore ISO references.)

* No space before percent sign.

* No bracketing of tolerance in percentage (e.g. `15 Â± 7 % .`)

* No recommendations, permissions or requirements (detected by keyword) in:
foreword, scope, introduction, term examples and examples, notes, footnotes.

* No subclauses that are the only child of a clause. (In clauses, annexes, or
scopes.)

* 5 levels of subclause nesting. (Never actuated, AsciiDoc only permits 4
levels of subsections.)

* Non-ISO/IEC reference turning up as normative.

* Term definition starts with an article, or ends with a period.

* Title intro or title part appears in only one of French or English.

In addition, the gem checks all terms cited from the IEV Electropedia against
the online IEV Electropedia entry, and issues a warning if the term is different.

== Approach
=== Document model

The document model ("IsoDoc") used in document generation
intends to introduce rigour into the ISO
standards authoring process; the existing 
https://www.iso.org/iso-templates.html[Microsoft Word template from ISO]
do not support such rigour down to the element level. It also introduces
flexibility by decoupling the document structure from its presentation.

The ISO International Standard format is prescribed in
http://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir-2%7Bed7.0%7Den.pdf[ISO/IEC DIR 2 "Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents"],
to a level amenable to an explicit document model. A formal document
model would allow checking for consistency in format and content, and expedite
authoring and quality control of ISO standards. Authoring standards through a 
more abstract formal model also permit enhanced functionality such as 
cross-reference link checking and auto-numbering of sections, figures, tables and formulas.
Outputting a document in different languages also becomes straightforward.

The document model for ISO Standards specifically is derived from a more general
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model]. Other
ISO-like standards can also be derived from this more general model;
CSD (https://github.com/riboseinc/csd, https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-csd)
is one such instance.

The document model for ISO Standards contains all the structures described
in ISO/IEC DIR 2. It is expressed as a
link:lib/metanorma/iso/isostandard.rnc[Relax NG Compact schema]; actual
validation occurs against its link:lib/metanorma/iso/isostandard.rng[full Relax
NG counterpart]. 

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of ISO standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigour and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored. However the gem natively outputs HTML and Word output, so there should
not be much need for this.

In order to generate HTML preview output close to what is intended
in the ISO standard, the Asciidoc
document includes a fair amount of formatting instructions (e.g. disabling
section numbering where appropriate, the titling of Appendixes as Annexes), as
well as ISO boilerplate text, and predefined section headers (sections are
recognised by fixed titles such as `Normative References`). Authoring ISO
standards in this fashion assumes that users will be populating an Asciidoc
template, and not removing needed formatting instructions.

Asciidoctor has some formatting constraints because of its own document model,
that users need to be aware. For example, Asciidoc has a strict division between
inline and block elements, which disallows certain kinds of nesting; so a list
cannot be embedded within a paragraph, it can only constitute its own paragraph
(though lists themselves can be nested within each other). Asciidoctor also disallows
multiple paragraphs in footnotes, 
http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/footnotes-with-paragraph-breaks-td4130.html[by design].
(The document model does not impose this constraint, so you could edit the generated
XML to break up paragraphs within a footnote.)

[[model_additions]]
== Asciidoctor model additions

Refer also to https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc/blob/master/README.adoc; this section lists additions specific only to metanorma-iso

=== Additional warning types

Asciidoctor natively supports the ISO admonitions "Caution", "Warning", and "Important"
through its admonition syntax:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
CAUTION: This is a single-block caution

[WARNING]
====
This is a

multiple-block warning
====
--

If the admonitions "Danger" and "Safety Precaution" are needed, they should be indicated
through a `type` attribute, which will override the admonition type appearing in the Asciidoc:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[type=Danger]
CAUTION: This is a single-block caution

[WARNING,type=Safety Precaution]
====
This is a

multiple-block warning
====
--


== Features not visible in HTML preview

The gem uses built-in Asciidoc formatting as much as possible, so that users
can retain the ability to preview documents; for _Terms and Definitions_
clauses, which have a good deal of explicit structure, macros have been
introduced for semantic markup (admitted terms, deprecated terms, etc). 

The default HTML output of an Asciidoc-formatted ISO document is quite close to the
intended final output, with the following exceptions, and with the additional
exceptions listed <<model_additions,above>> as markup introduced for ISO markup. 
Note that the final
outputs of the conversion (Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML) do not have these exceptions,
and comply with the ISO Standard specifications.

* _Terms and Definitions_: each term is marked up as an unnumbered subclause,
the semantic markup of alternate and other terms is not rendered visually.

* _Formulas_: Asciidoctor has no provision for the automated numbering of
isolated block formulas ("stem"), and does not display the number assigned a
block formula in its default HTML processorâalthough it does provide automated
numbering of examples. Formula numbering is provided in the final outputs
of the conversion.

* _Missing elements_: The document model does not yet include Asciidoc elements
that do not appear to be relevant to ISO Standards; these will be ignored in
generating ISO XML. Those elements include:
** sidebars (`aside`) (as distinct from warnings),
** ASCII art/preformatted text (`literal`) (as distinct from sourcecode listings),
** page breaks (`thematic break`).

* _Markup_: Some connecting text which is used to convey markup structure is
left out: in particular, `DEPRECATED` and `SOURCE` (replaced by formatting
macros).

* _Tables_: Table footnotes are treated like all other footnotes: they are
rendered at the bottom of the document, rather than the bottom of the table,
and they are not numbered separately.

* _Cross-references_: Footnoted cross-references are indicated with the reference
text `fn` in isolation, or `fn:` as a prefix to the reference text. The default
HTML processor leaves these as is: if no reference text is given, only `fn`
will be displayed (though it will still hyperlink to the right reference).

* _References_: The convention for references is that ISO documents are cited
without brackets by ISO number, and optionally year, whether they are normative
or in the bibliography (e.g. `ISO 20483:2013`); while all other references are
cited by bracketed number in the bibliography (e.g. `[1]`). The default HTML
processor treats all references the same, and will bracket them (e.g. `[ISO
20483:2013]`). For the same reason, ISO references listed in the bibliography
will be listed under an ISO reference, rather than a bracketed number.

* _References_: References are rendered cited throughout, since they are
automated. For that reason, if reference is to be made to both an undated and a
dated version of an ISO reference, these need to be explicitly listed as
separate references. (This is not done in the Rice model document, which lists
ISO 6646, but under _Terms and Definitions_ cites the dated ISO 6646:2011.

* _References_: ISO references that are undated but published have their date
indicated under the ISO standards format in an explanatory footnote. Because of
constraints introduced by Asciidoctor, that explanation is instead given in
square brackets in Asciidoc format.

* _Annexes_: Subheadings cannot preserve subsection numbering, while also
appearing inline with their text (e.g. Rice document, Annex B.2): they appear
as headings in separate lines.

* _Annexes_: Cross-references to Annex subclauses are automatically prefixed
with `Clause` rather than `Annex` or nothing.

* _Metadata_: Document metadata such as document numbers, technical committees
and title wording are not rendered in the default HTML output.

* _Patent Notice_: Patent notices are treated and rendered as a subsection of
the introduction, with an explicit subheading.

* _Numbering_: The numbering of figures and tables is sequential in the default
HTML processor: it does not include the Clause or Annex number. This,
_Figure 1_, not _Figure A.1_.

* _Notes_: There is no automatic note numbering by the default HTML processor.

* _Review Notes_: The reviewer on the review note is not displayed.

* _Keys_: Keys to formulas and figures are expected to be marked up as
definition lists consistently, rather than as inline prose.

* _Figures_: Simple figures are marked up as images, figures containing
subfigures as examples. Numbering by the default HTML processor may be
inconsistent. Subfigures are automatically numbered as independent figures.

* _Markup_: The default HTML processor does not support CSS extensions such as
small caps or strike through, though these can be marked up as CSS classes
through custom macros in Asciidoctor: a custom CSS stylesheet will be needed to
render them.

== Bibliography integration

Bibliographic entries for ISO standards are expected to use the standard document
identifier as the item label; e.g.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
* [[[ref1,ISO 712]]], _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
--

By default, the `isobib` gem is used to look up the reference details for 
any item label prefixed with `ISO` on the ISO web site. The full bibliographic details 
of the item are screenscraped from the ISO site and inserted into the XML file 
(although only the title of the reference is used in rendering). The
http://www.electropedia.org[Electropedia] termbank is queried in validation, to confirm
that the cited entries in Terms and Definitions are the same as what is cited online;
those queries are routed through the `iev` gem

[[cache]]
The results of all `isobib` searches done to date, across all documents,
are cached in the global cache file `~/.relaton-bib.pstore`, 
so they do not need to be re-fetched each time a document is processed. 
(The web query takes a few seconds per reference.)

The results of all `isobib` searches done to date for the current document
(`filename.adoc`) are stored in the same directory as the current document,
in the file `{filename}.relaton.pstore`. The local cache overrides entries in
the global cache, and can be manually edited. The local cache is only used
if the `:local-cache:` or `:local-cache-only:` document attribute is set.

If the document attribute `:no-isobib:` is set, the reference details for
items are not looked up via `isobib`, and the `isobib` caches are not used.
If the document attribute `:no-isobib-cache:` is set, the reference details for
items are still looked up via `isobib`, but the `isobib` caches are not used.

Any entry in the cache that corresponds to an undated ISO reference fetches its details
from the latest available entry on the ISO web site. If the entry is more than 60
days old, it is refetched.

The results of all `iev` searches done to date across all documents are cached
in the global cache fule `~/iev.pstore`, and the results of all `iev` searches 
done to date for the current document are stored in the same directory as the
current document, in the file `(filename).iev.pstore`.

== Document Attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. These include:

`:nodoc:`:: Do not generate Word and HTML output, only generate XML output.
Can be used as a command-line option (like all other document attributes):
`asciidoctor -a nodoc -b iso -r "metanorma-iso" a.adoc`

`:novalid:`:: Suppress validation.

`:flush-caches:`:: If set, delete and reinitialise the <<cache,cache>> of `isobib` searches
for ISO references from the ISO web site.

`:no-isobib:`:: If set, do not use the `isobib` or `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, nor the <<cache,cache>> of `isobib` and `iev` searches.

`:no-isobib-cache:`:: If set, use the `isobib` and `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, but do not use the <<cache,cache>> of `isobib` and `iev` searches.

`:local-cache:`:: Use the local isobib and iev search caches to override the global isobib and iev search
caches.

`:local-cache-only:`:: Use the local isobib and iev search caches to the exclusion of the global isobib and iev search
caches.

`:i18nyaml:`:: Name of YAML file of internationalisation text, to use instead
of the built-in English, French or Chinese text used to label parts of the document
(e.g. "Table", "Foreword", boilerplate text for Normative References, etc.)
Use if you wish to output an ISO standard in a language other than those three.
A sample YAML file for English, with "Foreword" replaced with "Frontispiece",
is available at link:spec/examples/english.yaml[].

`:docnumber:`:: The ISO document number (mandatory)

`:tc-docnumber:`:: The document number assigned by the Technical committee

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:draft:`:: The document draft (used in addition to document stage, for multiple iterations: expected format _X.Y_)

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:library-ics:` :: The ICS (International Categorization for Standards) number for the standard. There may be more than one ICS for a document; if so, they should be comma-delimited. (The ics identifier is added to the document metadata, but is not output to the current document templates.)

`:title-intro-en:`:: The introductory component of the English title of the
document

`:title-main-en:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:title-part-en:`:: The English title of the document part

`:title-intro-fr:`:: The introductory component of the French title of the
document. (This document template presupposes authoring in English; a different
template will be needed for French, including French titles of document
components such as annexes.)

`:title-main-fr:`:: The main component of the French title of the document
(mandatory). 

`:title-part-fr:`:: The French title of the document part

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see
https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html[ISO deliverables: The different types of ISO publications]
) (mandatory). The permitted types are:
`international-standard, technical-specification, technical-report,
publicly-available-specification, international-workshop-agreement, guide`.

`:docstage:`:: The stage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes])

`:docsubstage:`:: The substage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes])

`:iteration:`:: The iteration of a stage, in case there have been multiple drafts
(e.g. `2` on a `CD`: this is the second iteration through the `CD` stage).

`:confirmed-date:`::
The date on which the standard was reviewed and approved by the issuing authority.

`:unchanged-date:`::
The date on which the standard was last renewed without any changes in content.

`:circulated-date:`::
The date on which the unpublished standard was last circulated officially as a preprint. For standards, this is associated with the latest transition to a formally defined preparation stage, such as Working Draft or Committee Draft.

`:date:`::
An arbitrary date in the production of the standard. Content of the attribute should be a token, giving the type of date, then space, then the date itself. Multiple dates can be added as `:date_2:`, `date_3`, etc.

The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.

The document proper can reference the values of document attributes, which is convenient
for reusability. For example,
the Rice Model document references the editorial groups that have contributed to the 
document as

[source,asciidoc]
--
This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC {technical-committee-number}, _{technical-committee}_, Subcommittee SC {subcommittee-number}, _{subcommittee}_.
--

If the corresponding document attributes are not populated in the header, then the references
themselves will not be populated.


== Data Models

The IsoDoc data model (IsoStandardDocument) is instantiated from the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model]. For details
please visit that page.

== Code Structure

The gem invokes the following other gems as a division of labour.

* This gem generates the IsoDoc XML proper
* https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc renders IsoDoc XML into HTML
* https://github.com/riboseinc/html2doc converts HTML into Microsoft Word
* https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models derives the ISO Standard grammar
used for validation from the generic IsoDoc grammar


== Examples

The gem has been tested to date against the
https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100407.html["Rice document"], the ISO's
model document of an international standard. Sample representation of the Rice document
in Asciidoctor, and output formats, are included in the https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-rice
repository.

See also `link:spec/metanorma-iso[]` for individual features.
