== Introduction 

This document was developed in response to worldwide demand for minimum specifications for rice traded internationally, since most commercial bulks of grain, which have not been screened or aspirated, contain a proportion of other grains, weed seeds, chaff, straw, stones, sand, etc. The vegetable materials can have physical and biological properties which differ from those of the main constituent and can therefore affect the storage behaviour. 

Rice is a permanent host to a considerable microflora; most of these microorganisms are cosmopolitan, the majority are innocuous, but some produce harmful by-products. Microflora communities present on freshly harvested rice include many types of bacteria, moulds and yeasts. While the rice is ripening and its moisture content is falling, the number of field microorganisms, mainly bacteria, diminishes. When the rice is harvested, it is invaded by storage microorganisms and the field microflora gradually dies out. If the mass fraction of moisture (formerly expressed as moisture content) is less than 18 %, the microflora does not multiply, whereas above 18 % it does so rapidly. Thus, at harvest, the qualitative and the quantitative composition of the microflora depends more upon ecological factors than upon the variety of the rice. During transport and storage, additions to the microfloral population occur. Microorganisms on the rice at harvest tend to die out during storage and are replaced by microorganisms adapted to storage conditions. 

Storage losses have been estimated as being an average of 5 %, and as much as 30 %, especially in countries with climates favourable to the rapid development of agents of deterioration and where storage techniques are poorly developed, such as developing countries in the damp tropics. The magnitude of these figures highlights the need to promote throughout the world a rapid improvement in techniques of conservation.

27 ISO :2016(E) Annex A (normative) Determination of defects A.1 Principle Extraneous matter, broken kernels, damaged kernels and other kinds of rice are separated manually according to the following types: husked rice, milled rice, husked parboiled rice and milled parboiled rice. Each type is then weighed. A.2 Apparatus The usual laboratory apparatus and, in particular, the following. A.2.1 Sample divider, consisting of a conical sample divider or multiple-slot sample divider with a distribution system, e.g. Split-it-right sample divider, such as that shown in Figure A.1. A.2.2 A.2.3 A.2.4 A.2.5 A.2.6 Sieve, with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm. Tweezers. Scalpel. Paintbrush. Steel bowls, of diameter 100 mm ± 5 mm; seven per test sample. A.2.7 Balance, which can be read to the nearest 0,01 g. A.3 Sampling See Clause 5. A.4 Procedure A.4.1 Preparation of test sample Carefully mix the laboratory sample to make it as uniform as possible, then proceed to reduce it, using a divider (A.2.1), until a quantity of about 30 g is obtained. All parts of kernels which get stuck in the perforations of a sieve should be considered to be retained by the sieve. ISO 2016 All rights reserved 7 ISO Model document of an International Standard 25
28 Since the Split-it-right sample divider, shown in Figure A.1, is the subject of patent rights, it is necessary to provide details in the Introduction. The meanings of the symbols used in a formula are explained in a list underneath (as shown) unless the symbols are listed in a seperate Symbols clause (see ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, Clause 17). For further information on Mathematical formulae, see ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, Clause ISO Model document of an International Standard
29 ISO :2016(E) Figure A.1 Split-it-right sample divider A.5 Determination Weigh, to the nearest 0,1 g, one of the test samples obtained in accordance with A.4.1 and separate the different defects into the bowls (A.2.6). When a kernel has several defects, classify it in the defect category for which the maximum permissible value is the lowest (see Table 1). Weigh, to the nearest 0,01 g, the fractions so obtained. A.6 Calculation Express the mass fraction of each defect using Formula (A.1): m w = D ms (A.1) where w is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample; m D is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect; m S is the mass, in grams, of the test sample. A.7 Test report Report the results as specified in Clause 7. 8 ISO 2016 All rights reserved ISO Model document of an International Standard 27
30 Annex B is informative because the use of the method is optional (see 6.2 where Annex B is cited). However, it does contain requirements because it specifies the procedure to be followed if the user of the document chooses to follow this method. An optional clause entitled Principle indicates the essential steps in a test method. B.2.4 shows an example of how to express tolerances. If any dangerous reagents are listed in the Reagents clause, provide a warning (in bold). As in the Apparatus clauses (Clauses A.2 and B.2), if there is an introductory phrase before the list of reagents, this is not a hanging paragraph. The layout of a Reagents clause is similar to that of an Apparatus clause : reference number (in bold) name of item (in bold) descriptive text (if necessary) For further information on Reagents clauses, see ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, The use of trade names should be avoided. A designation or description of a product should be given instead. If a trade name is given (see B.3.2), a footnote should be added. Footnote 3) gives an example of suitable wording to be used when a trade name is given.
